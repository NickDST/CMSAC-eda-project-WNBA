## Motivation

- **Motivation:** there has been very little analysis done with WNBA data

  - At both the college and pro level, women's basketball has far less recognition than men's
  
  - This EDA experience can help us get our hands dirty with WNBA data and spark questions for future analysis for both for ourselves and listeners
  
```{r, out.width = "50%" ,echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "The gym at 2021 March Madness for women (left) versus men (right)"}

## Data

.pull-left[
- We used data for the **first 9-12 games** each of the 12 WNBA teams played starting May 13, 2021. 
  - **64 games total**

- Data structured by row, each representing a shot 
]
.pull-right[

- We specifically used information on:
  - Shot coordinates
  - Period/clock time
  - Shot type & result
  - Score
  - Team and player shooting
]
```{r out.width='30%', echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
data_example <- wnba_shots_data %>%
  mutate(shooter = word(text, 1, 2)) %>%
  rename(`shot type` = type_text, clock = clock_display_value, period = period_display_value, x = coordinate_x, y = coordinate_y) %>%
  select(`shot type`, clock, shooter, period, x, y)

## How do we determine dissimilarity between two games for SEA's shot-distance?

- (simple solution) Euclidian distance between games (A, B)
  - Add the difference between each bucket for A and B and square root the result
  
- Hierarchical clutering on the distance matrix

- Maximum Linkage

```{r, include=FALSE}
total_games <- c(401320570, 401320578, 401320583, 401320590, 401320595, 401320605, 401320610, 401320617)

game_dist <- readRDS("nick_data/game_dist.RData")
game_hclust <- hclust(game_dist, method = "complete")

## assign the lookup table based on how many clusters we want
game_cluster_lookup <- tibble(game_id = as.factor(total_games) , game_cluster = as.factor(cutree(game_hclust, k = 3)))


## annotating the original distance_percent_df with the clusters assigned
lookup_table <- sea_wgames %>% 
  mutate(game_id = as.factor(game_id)) %>% 
  dplyr::select(game_id, game_title) %>%

lookup_table[5,2] = "SEA (W) vs MIN (L) pt2"

# Shot data is essential to strategy
- **Shot Charts:** Teams can analyze their upcoming opponent’s frequent shot locations and design their defensive scheme to counter these hot spots


- **Clutch data:** Coaches can draw up end-of-game plays to create shots their most clutch scorers

- **Development of Shots across Quarters:** Teams can find patterns in how their opponents' coaches adjust their offense throughout the game --> anticipate these changes and counter them
