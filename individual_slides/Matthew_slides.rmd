## Motivation

- **Motivation:** there has been very little analysis done with WNBA data

  - At both the college and pro level, women's basketball has far less recognition than men's
  
  - This EDA experience can help us get our hands dirty with WNBA data and spark questions for future analysis for both for ourselves and listeners
  
```{r, out.width = "50%" ,echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "The gym at 2021 March Madness for women (left) versus men (right)"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.cbc.ca/1.5956191.1616160435!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_940/weights.jpg")

## Data

.pull-left[
- We used data for the **first 9-12 games** each of the 12 WNBA teams played starting May 13, 2021. 
  - **64 games total**

- Data structured by row, each representing a shot 
]
.pull-right[

- We specifically used information on:
  - Shot coordinates
  - Period/clock time
  - Shot type & result
  - Score
  - Team and player shooting
]
```{r out.width='30%', echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
data_example <- wnba_shots_data %>%
  mutate(shooter = word(text, 1, 2)) %>%
  rename(`shot type` = type_text, clock = clock_display_value, period = period_display_value, x = coordinate_x, y = coordinate_y) %>%
  select(`shot type`, clock, shooter, period, x, y)
knitr::kable(head(data_example), format = 'html')
```

### Each WNBA teams' favorite spots to shoot from 
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 15, fig.height = 8.5, fig.align='center'}
geom_basketball(league = "WNBA", full_surf = FALSE, rotate = TRUE) + 
  stat_summary_hex(data = filter(wnba_shots, coordinate_y <= 40), 
                   mapping = aes(x = coordinate_x - 25, y = coordinate_y - 47 + 4, 
                                 z = shot_taken, group = -1), 
                   binwidth = c(4,4),
                   fun = function(x) ifelse (length(x) > 8, sum(x), NA)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "darkblue", high = "darkorange") +
  facet_wrap(~ team_record, ncol = 4) + theme(legend.position = "bottom")

### The best teams in the WNBA adopt the Daryl Morey offensive strategy
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 15, fig.height = 7}
five_teams <- filter(wnba_shots, team_name %in% c("Las Vegas", "Connecticut", "Seattle", "New York"))
geom_basketball(league = "WNBA", full_surf = FALSE, rotate = TRUE) + 
  stat_summary_hex(data = filter(five_teams, coordinate_y <= 40), 
                   mapping = aes(x = coordinate_x - 25, y = coordinate_y - 47 + 4, 
                                 z = shot_taken, group = -1), 
                   binwidth = c(4,4),
                   fun = function(x) ifelse (length(x) > 8, sum(x), NA)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "darkblue", high = "darkorange") +
  facet_wrap(~ team_record, ncol = 5) + theme(legend.position = "bottom") 
```
.footnote[Key takeaway: The top teams take efficient shots;  they prioritize launching from downtown and attacking the basket]

## The Storm shoot ALOT of three pointers 
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 11, fig.height = 5.5}

# Shot data is essential to strategy
- **Shot Charts:** Teams can analyze their upcoming opponentâ€™s frequent shot locations and design their defensive scheme to counter these hot spots


- **Clutch data:** Coaches can draw up end-of-game plays to create shots their most clutch scorers

- **Development of Shots across Quarters:** Teams can find patterns in how their opponents' coaches adjust their offense throughout the game --> anticipate these changes and counter them
