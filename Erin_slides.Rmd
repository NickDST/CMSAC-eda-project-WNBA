## Motivation

- **Motivation:** there has been very little analysis done with WNBA data

  - At both the college and pro level, women's basketball has far less recognition than men's
  
  - This EDA experience can help us get our hands dirty with WNBA data and spark questions for future analysis for both for ourselves and listeners

## Data

.pull-left[
- We used data for the **first 9-12 games** each of the 12 WNBA teams played starting May 13, 2021. 
  - **64 games total**

- Data structured by row, each representing a shot 
]
.pull-right[

- We specifically used information on:
  - Shot coordinates
  - Period/clock time
  - Shot type & result
  - Score
  - Team and player shooting
]


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
data_example <- wnba_shots_data %>%
  mutate(shooter = word(text, 1, 2)) %>%
  select(type_text, clock_display_value, shooter, period_display_value, home_score, away_score, coordinate_x, coordinate_y)
knitr::kable(head(data_example), format = 'html')
```

## Question 1: What are each WNBA teams' favorite spots to shoot from? 
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 11, fig.height = 6}
geom_basketball(league = "WNBA", full_surf = FALSE, rotate = TRUE) + 
  stat_summary_hex(data = filter(wnba_shots, coordinate_y <= 40), 
                   mapping = aes(x = coordinate_x - 25, y = coordinate_y - 47 + 4, 
                                 z = shot_taken, group = -1), 
                   binwidth = c(4,4),
                   fun = function(x) ifelse (length(x) > 8, sum(x), NA)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "darkblue", high = "darkorange") +
  facet_wrap(~ team_record, ncol = 4) + theme(legend.position = "bottom")

## Diving deeper... Are there patterns of where the best teams like to shoot from?
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 15, fig.height = 4}
five_teams <- filter(wnba_shots, team_name %in% c("Las Vegas", "Connecticut", "Seattle", "New York","Indiana"))
geom_basketball(league = "WNBA", full_surf = FALSE, rotate = TRUE) + 
  stat_summary_hex(data = filter(five_teams, coordinate_y <= 40), 
                   mapping = aes(x = coordinate_x - 25, y = coordinate_y - 47 + 4, 
                                 z = shot_taken, group = -1), 
                   binwidth = c(4,4),
                   fun = function(x) ifelse (length(x) > 8, sum(x), NA)) +

## What spots do the top scorers on the Storm shoot from?
